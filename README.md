# Borrowing from Session Types

This repository contains an implementation of a typechecker and interpreter
for the language from the paper *Borrowing from Session Types*.

The implementation supports all features mentioned in the paper and additionally
supports the following features:

- unrestricted base types `String`, `Int`, and `Bool` with the usual operations;

- unrestricted function types;

- recursive function definitions and recursive session types;

- irrefutable pattern matching in let expressions for products;

- a function that prints to stdout.

- `new S` differs from the paper that it's not a function but it's as if already applied to `Unit`. 

Note that the `spawn` expression differs from the paper in that it is
call-by-need, and hence does not require you to wrap its subexpression in a
lambda, e.g. instead of `spawn (λ(). e)` you can directly write `spawn e`.

## Installation

### Docker

1.  Build the image via

    ```bash
    docker-compose build
    ```

2.  Run the image via

    ```bash
    docker-compose run bsti
    ```

    This drops you into an interactive bash shell, where the compiled
    interpreter `bsti` is already on the `PATH`.

3.  Typecheck and interpret a program via e.g.

    ```bash
    bsti examples/positive/example-simple.bgv
    ```

    The current host directory is mounted into the current guest directory, so
    it is possible to change or add examples on the host without having to
    rebuild the image.

### From Source

Install a recent version of stable rust. See the following URL for instructions:

https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

The following command will compile the project and its dependencies (if necessary),
and then typecheck and run the file `SOURCE_FILE`:

```bash
cargo run -- SOURCE_FILE
```

## Syntax

The following grammar describes the complete, concrete syntax supported by the interpreter.
For readability, operator precedence, associativity and whitespace are omitted.

Variables
x ::= [a-zA-Z_]+[a-zA-Z0-9_]*

Labels
l ::= [a-zA-Z_]+[a-zA-Z0-9_]*

Integer Literals
<int> ::= '-'? [0-9]+

String Literals
<str> ::= '"' [^"]* '"'             (strings like "foo")
        | '\'' [^"]* '\''           (strings like 'foo')
        | '\'\'\'' [^"]* '\'\'\''   (strings like '''foo''')

Patterns
p ::= x                             (variable pattern)
    | '(' p1 ',' p2 ')'             (pair pattern)
    
Program
P ::= e                             (main expression)
```

We also provide unicode alternatives for certain tokens:

- A lambda `\x. e` can also be written as `λx. e`

- A function type `t1 -[ m E ]-> t2` can also be written as `t1 –[ m E ]→ t2`

- An unordered product type `t1 *[ p ] t2` can also be written as `t1 ⊗ t2`

- A left-ordered product type `t1 *[ l ] t2` can also be written as `t1 ⊙ t2`

- A recursive session type `mu x. s` can also be written as `µ x. s`

Comments are started with a `#` and range until the end of the line.

## Examples

The following shows the obligatory math server example:

```agda
let 
  server : ?Int.?Int.!Int.Wait -[ u 1 ]→ Unit
  server c =
    let x = recv &c in
    let y = recv &c in
    send (x + y) &c;
    wait c
in

let
  client : !Int.!Int.?Int.Close -[ u 1 ]→ Unit
  client c =
    send 1 &c;
    send 2 &c;
    print (recv &c);
    close c
in

let c1, c2 = new !Int.!Int.?Int.Close in
fork (server c2);
client c1
```

This example can also be written without the syntactic sugar for Haskell-style
function definitions, i.e. as simple `let`-expressions, where the body is
a lambda wrapped in a type annotation expression `(\c. …) : t`:

```agda
let 
  server = \c.
    let x = recv &c in
    let y = recv &c in
    send (x + y) &c;
    wait c
  : ?Int.?Int.!Int.Wait -[ u 1 ]→ Unit
in

let
  client = \c.
    send 1 &c;
    send 2 &c;
    print (recv &c);
    close c
  : !Int.!Int.?Int.Close -[ u 1 ]→ Unit
in

let c1, c2 = new !Int.!Int.?Int.Close in
fork (server c2);
client c1
```

`examples` subdirectory.
